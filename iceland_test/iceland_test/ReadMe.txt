The solution is written for web .NET MVC Core 2.2 and as a base a default MVC Core 2.2 project has been used.

Open the project in Visual Studio 2017 (latest patch required) and press F5 to run it.

The solution is running on the index (home) page.

The grid with some very minor styling on it represents the inventory.

Below the grid three controls are present as following:

1. 'MOVE TO THE NEXT DAY' - Day is incremented by 1 and inventory gets processed.
2. 'LET'S HAVE CONCERT TONIGHT' - This will execute a concert event which affects some of the inventory items as described.
3. 'RESET' - The initial inventory gets loaded up and you can start all over again.

The page acts both as a display as well as a data storage so there is no database needed to hold the values.
